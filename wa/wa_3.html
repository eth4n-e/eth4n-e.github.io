            <h1>Svelte</h1>
            <p>
                Svelte is a free and open-source component-based front-end software framework, and language
                created by Rich Harris and maintained by the Svelte core team members.
                <br>
                <br>
                Svelte is not a monolithic JavaScript library imported by applications: instead, Svelte compiles HTML
                templates to specialized code that manipulates the DOM directly, which may reduce the size of
                transferred files and give better client performance. Application code is also processed by the
                compiler, inserting calls to automatically recompute data and re-render UI elements when the data
                they depend on is modified. This also avoids the overhead associated with runtime intermediate
                representations, such as virtual DOM, unlike traditional frameworks (such as React and Vue) which
                carry out the bulk of their work at runtime, i.e. in the browser.
                <br>
                <br>
                The compiler itself is written in JavaScript. Its source code is licensed under MIT License and
                hosted on GitHub. Among comparable frontend libraries, Svelte has one of the smallest bundle
                footprints at merely 2KB.

                    The predecessor of Svelte is Ractive.js, which Rich Harris created in 2013.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Version 1 of Svelte was written in JavaScript and was released on 29 November 2016. It was basically
                    Ractive with a compiler. The name Svelte was chosen by Rich Harris and his coworkers at The
                    Guardian.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Version 2 of Svelte was released on 19 April 2018. It set out to correct what the maintainers viewed
                    as mistakes in the earlier version such as replacing double curly braces with single curly
                    braces.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Version 3 of Svelte was written in TypeScript and was released on 21 April 2019. It rethought
                    reactivity by using the compiler to instrument assignments behind the scenes.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The SvelteKit web framework was announced in October 2020 and entered beta in March 2021.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Version 4 of Svelte was released on 22 June 2023. It's a maintenance release, smaller and faster
                    than version 3. A part of this release was an internal rewrite from TypeScript back to
                    JavaScript, with JSDoc annotations. This was met with a confusion from the developer community,
                    which was addressed by the creator of Svelte, Rich Harris.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Key early contributors became involved with Conduitry joining with the release of Svelte 1, Tan Li
                    Hau joining in 2019, and Ben McCann joining in 2020. Rich Harris and Simon Holthausen joined
                    Vercel to work on Svelte fulltime in 2022. Dominic Gannaway joined Vercel from the React core
                    team to work on Svelte fulltime in 2023.

                    <br>
                    SvelteKit 1.0 was released in December 2022 after two years in development.

                <p>
                    Svelte applications and components are defined in .svelte files, which are HTML files extended with
                    templating syntax that is based on JavaScript and is similar to JSX.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Svelte repurposes JavaScript's native labeled statement syntax $: to mark reactive statements.
                    Top-level variables become the component's state and exported variables become the properties that
                    the component receives. Additionally, the { JavaScript code } syntax can be used for templating in
                    HTML elements and components, which is shown below:
                </p>
                <div class="code">
                    <div>

                            <code>$: doubled = count * 2;</code>

                    The Svelte maintainers created SvelteKit as the official way to build projects with Svelte. It is a
                    Next.js-style framework that dramatically reduces the amount of code that gets sent to the browser.
                    The maintainers had previously created Sapper, which was the predecessor of SvelteKit.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Svelte maintainers also maintain a number of integrations for popular software projects under
                    the Svelte organization including integrations for Vite, Rollup, Webpack, TypeScript, VS Code,
                    Chrome Developer Tools, ESLint, and prettier. A number of external projects such as Storybook
                    have also created integrations with Svelte and SvelteKit.

                    Vue.js modeled its API and single-file components after Ractive.js, the predecessor of Svelte.

                    Svelte is widely praised by developers. Taking the top ranking in multiple large scale developer
                    surveys, it was chosen as the Stack Overflow 2021 most loved web framework and 2020 State of JS
                    frontend framework with the most satisfied developers.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Svelte has been adopted by a number of high-profile web companies including The New York Times,
                    Apple, Spotify, Radio France (French national public radio broadcaster), Square, Yahoo,
                    ByteDance, Rakuten, Bloomberg, Reuters, Ikea, Facebook, FrontPopulaire-2024 and Brave.

                    <br>
                    A community group of non-maintainers run the Svelte Summit conference, write a Svelte newsletter,
                    host a Svelte podcast, and host a directory of Svelte tooling, components, and templates.
