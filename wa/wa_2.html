            I am a third year student majoring in 
            <strong>computer science</strong> and minoring in 
            <strong>CTD</strong>. 
            For this course, I hope to improve my web development skills, particularly I would love 
            to gain a better understanding of UI / UX design. I also want to get better at vanilla JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>I enjoy weightlifting, music, reading, programming, cooking and much more</p>
